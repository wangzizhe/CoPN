# IV. Challenge

The idea of using CoPN for context-oriented Modelica is great, but like any approach, it has its challenges. The biggest challenge in implementing this idea in Modelica is the complexity of building the CoPN. As you’ve already seen with the context relationships, managing multiple relationships can make the model very complicated. In Modelica, you must define how many input/output ports each place and transition have and connect them carefully, one by one. Each port can only be connected once, and no ports should be left unconnected. With more than three contexts, managing all these ports and connections can become very confusing, and debugging becomes increasingly complex.

But here’s the good news: I have the `CoPNCompositor` for you!
